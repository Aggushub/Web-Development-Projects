# Digital Clock ⏰

This is a digital clock built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, developed as part of my learning journey through a **Udemy** course. It shows the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating live every second.

### 🌟 What's Coming Next

Stay tuned—this simple clock is just getting started 😉!!!
